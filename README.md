# Ziggo Mediabox Next

## Description
A media_player component for Home Assistant that creates media_players for each Ziggo Media Box Next in your account.
Forked from the original project to change APIs urls from the dutch version to point to Swizerland UPC ones. No other changes. Please thank the original brain behind this great work

## Prerequisites
- You need a Ziggo account with a Ziggo Media Box Next.
- The energy mode needs to be set to high ("Hoog" in Dutch), otherwise you are not able to switch the device on in the media player.

## Installation

1. Open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find configuration.yaml).
2. If you do not have a custom_components directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the custom_components directory (folder) create a new folder called ziggo_mediabox_next.
4. Download all the files from the custom_components/ziggo_mediabox_next/ directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Add media_player entry to configuration (see below)
7. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration
```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: ziggo_mediabox_next
    username: !secret ziggo_username
    password: !secret ziggo password
  
```
Media players are generated with a name based on the id Ziggo provided. You can add a ```friendly_name``` in the customize section in your configuration.

### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description
| --- | ----------- | --- | --- |
| username | string | yes | Your Ziggo username |
| password | string | yes | Your Ziggo password |
